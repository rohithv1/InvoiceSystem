# InvoiceSystem
SMEs supply limited items to Retail shops/chains in limited quantity Shelf size is limited hence can’t stock too many Typically SME’s visit the store weekly once and based on their own statistical information, decide how much more stock to be added into the shelf. Based on added stock, SME representative has to generate the invoice and get it signed by store owner for later billing. This invoice has to be synced back to SME’s accounting/financial system to generate bills
